# 🏭 Machine Failure Prediction – MDA512 Group Project

This project is part of the MDA512 Data Science subject, focused on developing a business model for efficient operations. Our goal is to predict the risk of machine failure in industrial environments using real sensor data and classification models.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Custom machine sensor data
- Features include: Temperature, Vibration, Power Usage, Humidity, and Machine Type
- Target variable: `Failure_Risk` (1 = failure likely, 0 = no failure)

## 🧪 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## 📈 Results
Gradient Boosting performed best with the highest F1-score and lowest misclassification.

## 📁 Files Included
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebook used for analysis
- `data/` – Machine sensor dataset
- `reports/` – Final report (DOCX and HTML format)
- `presentation/` – Final group presentation slides

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
